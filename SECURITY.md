## Reporting a Vulnerability

***Please note: As this is free software which offers no income for me I am not offering a bug-bounty of any kind at this time.***\
***This is an unofficial passion project fork; there are no guarantees of response time or fixes.***

Please open a [Bug Report](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/OrcaSlicer/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml>) or start a [PR](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/OrcaSlicer/pulls>) if you have identified any issues.

If you wish to disclose any vulnerabilities you have found privately you may use [the Security tab](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/OrcaSlicer/security>).

## What to include

- Repro steps and expected vs actual behavior.
- Affected OS and build SHA7 and install binary used.
- Minimal files (3MF/G-code/config) with secrets removed.

## Disclosure channel

- Preferred: Public issue or fix PR; private disclosures are not preferred.
- Otherwise: GitHub Security tab for private reports; no other channels are monitored.

## Response expectations

- Best-effort only; responses may be slow and fixes are not guaranteed.

## Coordinated disclosure

- If you report privately, please hold off public disclosure to allow a fix/release; this fork does not offer coordinated disclosure timelines.

## Data handling

- Do not include personal data, access tokens, or printer credentials in reports or attachments.
